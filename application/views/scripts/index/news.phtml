            We thank the support of our patients through these early years. We couldn't have done it without you. 
            We now have over 2,600 active patients. Let us continue to serve you.

            We will be able to check patients' electrical rhythm via an app/iphone that we can rent out to the patients. The rhythm will be sent automatically into patients' charts. How cool is that?!?

            Dr. Kwak has purchased a panoptic ophthalmoscope to better visualize the back of the eyes and using an app/iphone he can even take photos of the patients' eyes and save it in patients' charts. 

            Folks, also you can send secure emails to Dr. Kwak through your patientfusion portal website where you can check your lab results and schedule appointments yourselves. 

            As we see more exciting technological advancements, we'll keep implementing to our practice.</a>
